          "description": "JSON is one of the most common data interchange formats there is. Thankfully, it is also a pretty simple one. I had written a JSON parser in C++ sometime back, and whilst making it I came across a few decisions that were more involved than I thought they would be. So I have decided to write an article around that JSON Parser. While JSON Parsing is simple, writing one would definitely be useful to build more complex parsers, since the general principles are still present.",

As a brief detour, the perspective of programmers comes full circle as they move from beginner to slightly experienced to intermediate.\nThe beginner is deathly afraid of the differences between programming languages. In the beginning, they stick to one language out of the fear of learning something new.",

My older blogs are many years behind me, and now a new journey begins.\nI have witnessed a stark change in how I view blogging, or how I view writing in general over my 4 years of college. More on that in a later post, but I’m excited to embark on this new journey, incorporating the many insights hidden away in some deep dark corner of my Google Keep.",
